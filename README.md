# PATENT-WORK-Dual OTP and Fingerprint-Based Two-Step Authentication System

Overview

The Dual OTP and Fingerprint-Based Two-Step Authentication System is an advanced security framework designed to enhance the integrity of online financial transactions. By requiring dual-layer authentication for both the sender and receiver using OTPs and biometric fingerprint verification, this system minimizes unauthorized access and protects against fraud.

Key Features

Dual Authentication: Combines OTP-based and fingerprint-based authentication for robust security.

Sender and Receiver Verification: Both parties must authenticate, ensuring mutual trust and safety.

Fingerprint Mapping: Maps individual digits of the OTP to specific fingerprints for unique verification.

Real-Time Verification: Integrates with a server to validate user credentials dynamically.

Enhanced Security: Prevents bypassing with OTP-only or fingerprint-only methods.

System Architecture

OTP Generation and Distribution: A unique OTP is generated for each transaction and distributed securely to both parties.

Fingerprint Matching: Uses a fingerprint scanner to validate user input based on predefined mappings.

Verification Process:

Sender enters the OTP and corresponding fingerprints.

Receiver completes the same process to approve the transaction.

Data Processing:

Real-time validation through an Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) mechanism.

Secure database storage for transaction logs and user credentials.

Technology Stack

Database: Oracle 11g for managing OTP and fingerprint mappings.

APIs: RESTful APIs for OTP distribution and fingerprint integration.

Programming Language: Java for back-end implementation and data handling.

Hardware: Fingerprint scanner for biometric authentication.

Installation Guide

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name

Set up the database with the provided schema in the db/schema.sql file.

Install required Java dependencies.

Connect the fingerprint scanner hardware and configure its API.

Deploy the application on your preferred server.

Workflow

Transaction Initialization: Sender initiates the transaction and receives an OTP.

Sender Authentication:

Enter each digit of the OTP.

Provide the corresponding fingerprint.

Receiver Authentication:

Repeat the OTP and fingerprint sequence.

Verification: Server validates the OTP and fingerprint data for both parties.

Transaction Completion: If authentication is successful, the transaction is processed.

Sample Code

Below is a sample Java function for validating OTP and fingerprint:

public class DualAuthTransaction {
    public boolean authenticateUser(String userType, String otp, String[] fingerprints) {
        String[] requiredPrints = getRequiredFingerprints(otp);
        for (int i = 0; i < otp.length(); i++) {
            if (!fingerprints[i].equals(requiredPrints[i])) {
                return false; // Authentication fails if any step does not match
            }
        }
        return true; // Successful authentication
    }
}

Use Cases

Online Banking: Secure peer-to-peer money transfers.

E-Commerce: Fraud prevention during digital payments.

Cryptocurrency: Enhanced authentication for wallet transfers (adaptation required).

Limitations

Requires fingerprint scanner hardware.

Centralized architecture may not align with decentralized systems like blockchain.

Future Enhancements

Integration with decentralized systems.

Support for additional biometric inputs.

AI-based anomaly detection for further fraud prevention.
